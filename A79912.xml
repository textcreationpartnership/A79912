            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving experience that his Maje≈øty, the Being and Operation of all things, appeareth in and to the Creature under a two-fold Form or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage, by which that becometh real with the Creature, which is but a ≈øhadow with this Infinite Being: So that from hence it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth, the Creature ≈øuppo≈øeth God to be that which is not, and that not to be, which is God.</p>
            <p>Therefore hath his Maje≈øty divulged his plea≈øure, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may take occa≈øion to unfold him≈øelf in and to the Creature under ≈øuch a pro≈øpect, that the Creature may know God, as he is known of God, that ≈øo from the clear appearance of God, the Creature may behold purely what God is, which as yet is manife≈øt, the Creation in this Nation inhabiteth in no other Region then the Woman of Samaria: And therefore it is the cry of his Maje≈øty is not fulfilled and obeyed, but by Churches, Saints, and Devils oppo≈øed and contemned: So that rare it is to find the Creature that is awaked out of his deep ≈øleep, that hath ≈øhaked off the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ≈øo that he can from the clear Appearance of God ≈øay, the vail is taken away, and that he believeth the Truth as it is in his Maje≈øty.</p>
            <p>In an≈øwer to this, I have travelled from one end of England to another, and as yet could find very few that could define unto me the Object of their Wor≈øhip, or give me a Character what that God is, ≈øo much profe≈ø≈øed by them; yet notwith≈øtanding I could come into no City, Town, nor Village, but there I heard the name God under one Form or another, wor≈øhipped that for God, which I had experience was no God: So that in the period of my Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, I concluded there was gods many, and lords many, although to me but one God: Therefore at my return, I was carried out by God to hold forth to the Creature, the God ye≈øterday, to day, and for ever.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:117915:3"/>
            <p> To that end, in the peru≈øal of his Maje≈øties plea≈øure, you may take notice what is intended, or rather, in the en≈øuing Treati≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, having for the pre≈øent but only pre≈øented to you a Map, in which you may take a full view what that God is thou pretends to Wor≈øhip, whether he be Infinite, or Finite; whether he be ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to pa≈ø≈øion and affection, whether he behold the actions of the creature as the Creature e≈øteem them, and whether he can be changed by thy prayers, ≈øo as to expiate a judgement, or produce a deliverance, yea whether he be all, and in all, or but all in part, that is to ≈øay, whether one act be good, another evil, one light, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other darkne≈øs; and if ≈øo, rea≈øon from Scripture declareth, God is pa≈ø≈øionate, God is affectionate, and if either, then changeable.</p>
            <p>But by forms and ≈øpiritual God like forms he is profe≈ø≈øed, and ≈øo wor≈øhipped as a God that beholds evil and good; ≈øo pa≈ø≈øionate with the one, and affectionate with the other, ≈øo that in conclu≈øion they imagine him as them≈øelves, not infinite, but finite, therefore it is, one Act in God is conceived two in them≈øelves, to wit, one Act Adultry, another Hone≈øty; when if Rea≈øon were admitted, and thereby Scripture interpreted, then ≈øhould they ob≈øerve in that Act they call Hone≈øty, to be Adultry, and that Act ≈øo called A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultry, to have as much hone≈øty as the other, for with God they are but one, and that one Act holy, ju≈øt, and good as God; This to me by Rea≈øon is confirmed, and by Scripture declared, <hi>That to the pure all things are pure:</hi> So that for my part I know nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean to me, no more then it is of it ≈øelf, and therefore what Act ≈øoever I do, is acted by that Maje≈øty in me, as in the en≈øuing Treati≈øe will appear what Acts they are, the nature of Acting them; and in the period: how I e≈øteem them: So that I weigh not how I am judged, in that I judge not my ≈øelf. So to conclude, the cen≈øures of Scripture, Churches, Saints, and Devils, are no more to me than the cuting off of a Dogs neck.</p>

            <p>To that end, be plea≈øed to peru≈øe the precedent ver≈øes, and you will find what occa≈øioned the≈øe terms in this Text; In brief, you may behold the Original thereof ari≈øe from the pre≈øent ≈øtate of the Gentiles, they being then as it were Pri≈øoners, and in the ≈øtate of darkne≈øs; So that in reference to their bondage, Chri≈øt called the Son of God was promi≈øed, to redeem them from the Region of Darkne≈øs; that notwith≈øtanding they had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipped that for God which was no god, yet now is the time come, now is the day that God will plunder them of their Idols, that God will enlighten their dark under≈øtandings, as in my Text, <hi>God will make darkne≈øs light before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding it may be ≈øuppo≈øed by ≈øome, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion hereof doth only concern the Gentiles, yet let me tell thee, I find that God is not ≈øo limitted in his pen, inke, and paper, but that he can and will make the darkne≈øs of the Jew light, as well as the Gentile; yea, the darkne≈øs of you as any other: for never was there more ≈øuper≈øtition, more darkne≈øs in the Churches than now, therefore never more need to have the light of God expel tho≈øe dark mi≈øts that at this time is ≈øpread over all opinions in the Kingdom: So that now doth the time draw neer
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117915:4"/> that the ≈øayings in this Text ≈øhall appear in the unfoldings of the Spirit, <hi>I will make darkne≈øs light before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being now arived at the wi≈øhed Haven, all the difficulty will be how to unload the Ve≈ø≈øel fraughted with ≈øuch hidden pearls, how to make merchandi≈øe of them, how to unfold this Subject to your capacity, how to give you the mind of God, in ≈øuch terms as God appears in you.</p>
            <p>And that the more, I find the unfoldings of God in this, ≈øeem to appear contrary to mo≈øt that is quoted in the Hi≈øtory; <hi>I will make darkne≈øs light;</hi> How is it po≈ø≈øible, when there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, no corre≈øpondency but enmity? Yea, ≈øo great, that they cannot dwell in one hou≈øe, lodge in one bed, but devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for where darkne≈øs is, light is not, and where light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, darkne≈øs is gone; yet notwith≈øtanding you hear, <hi>he will make darkne≈øs light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the fir≈øt thing I mind from hence is, <hi>That he will not take darkne≈øs away, and in the room thereof place light, but that which in Scripture is called darkne≈øs, and by the Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved darkne≈øs, ≈øhall be made light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly we ≈øhall enquire, <hi>Whether that in Scripture, or by the Creature entituled darkne≈øs, be darkne≈øs with God or no?</hi>

            <p>To this end you may read Light and Darkne≈øs are both alike to God. So then it appeareth but a darkne≈øs in the Creatures ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion, ≈øo but an imagined darkne≈øs; for ≈øaith the Text, <hi>God is light, and in him no darkne≈øs.</hi> So that you ≈øee, what≈øoever or how≈øoever it is called darkne≈øs in Scripture, yet it is none with God Then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ≈øhall ≈øearch, <hi>Whether that in Scripture or by the Creature called God, admit of any other Title but</hi> unus <hi>(to wit)</hi> One him≈øelf, <hi>and if I find there is but one Being, one God, and that all that is be light with God, then ≈øhall I not cea≈øe till I find the Original of Darkne≈øs, what it is, and why it is called dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, I find in his Divine Being, in his E≈ø≈øence, there is but one God; the hi≈øtory declareth the ≈øame. <hi>I am what I am: I am the Lord, and there is none el≈øe: There is no other God be≈øide me:</hi> with varieties of Scriptures to this purpo≈øe. So then, it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117915:4"/> cleer by the Hi≈øtory, That the Being and E≈ø≈øence of God admits not of the plural but ≈øingular.</p>
            <p>So that there is but one God, who≈øe Name is <hi>Light,</hi> ≈øo called God; for, that which God is, is God <hi>(to wit)</hi> God is light, then that light is God; for what God ≈øaith he is, that is him≈øelf, but God ≈øaith, He is light, therefore Light is God; ≈øo from the Scripture where God ≈øaid <hi>Let there be light,</hi> it is no more then if he had ≈øaid, Let there be God, and there was God, for God is Light. For,</p>
            <p>You have heard the Scripture holds forth but one God, which God is Light; yet the ≈øame Scripture holds forth not only light, but lights; as <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 14. <hi>Let there be Lights, and that Lights in the Firmament of the Heaven:</hi> So that God made two great lights, that is to ≈øay, The light of the Sun, the light of the Moon, Stars, fire, and candle. From hence take notice, that though but one God, yet divers Lights, and that all made by God; for he that ≈øaid <hi>Let there be light,</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Let there be Lights;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>The Father of Lights,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But then how ≈øhall we do with that place, <hi>For God is light,</hi> not lights; either he mu≈øt be as well lights as light, or el≈øe, that all other lights but one hath a Being and Original be≈øides God.</p>
            <p>And if it appear that all lights, or that which is called light, though the light of the candle, be made by God, then the light of the candle is the light of God; but if all that is called light, to wit, the light of the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fire, and Candle, have not their being in God, then not made by God; So it will follow, that there is not onely one, but two gods.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture ≈øaith, That <hi>God made the Light,</hi> and <hi>God made the Lights:</hi> So that both light and lights were made by God, then had they their being in God; for all that he made were in him, of him, and to him, as well the Sun as the Moon, the Stars, the Fire, and the Candle, as any of them; So that in making of the≈øe, he made nothing but him≈øelf; for God is light, as well the one as the other.</p>
            <p>But then, If God be light, then lights; ≈øo that we may as well ≈øay Gods, as God; a God of the Sun, another of the Moon; for in that God is light, he mu≈øt as well be the light of the Moon, as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117915:5"/> the light of the Sun, the light of the fire, the candle, as the ≈øtars.</p>
            <p>Not denying but God is as well the light of the one, as the light of the other; yet notwith≈øtanding that, God is but one light, and although called lights by God, yet they are but one light in God; to that end he is called <hi>The Father of Lights,</hi> but one Father, though many lights. So that why they are but one light in God, or God one light, and yet by God called lights, are in reference to their di≈øtinct appearance in tho≈øe ≈øeveral bodies (to wit) the body of the Sun, the body of the Moon; that as you ≈øee notwith≈øtanding ≈øeveral beams from one Sun, yet in their ri≈øe from the Sun, they were but one in the Sun; nay indeed, they were nothing but the Sun, but after they are i≈ø≈øued out of the Sun, one this way, another that way from the Sun, then according to this divers appearance, it is no more called a Sun, but a Beam, not only Beam, but Beams, which when reduced to their being, they are no longer called a Beam, but a Sun.</p>
            <p>So why they are called lights, and yet but one light with or in God, who is light, it is but according to its divers appearance, which in the being is but one appearance, becau≈øe he that is the being of the light, is the appearance of the light, in what kind or degree what≈øoever.</p>
            <p>So that now you may take notice, and in ≈øome mea≈øure behold what God is, and what is to be under≈øtood by tho≈øe terms, <hi>God is light, and light is God;</hi> which if it be that light is God, to wit, the light of the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fire, and Candle, which if the light appearing in the≈øe, and held forth by the≈øe, be the light of God, Why may not the whole Creation ≈øay with their brother <hi>Jacob, Surely God were in the≈øe, and we knew it not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But may be you will ≈øay, the light that is there recorded, is not to be under≈øtood the light of the Sun, Moon, &amp;c. but a light that is quoted in the≈øe ≈øeveral Scriptures, to wit, a divine and Spiritual light, by which a creature beholds and enjoy God.</p>
            <p>However God that is light appeareth in you, di≈øcovering to you that the light in the creature is not the ≈øame light of the Sun, yet the appearance of light in me, ≈øheweth me (and that from Scripture declareth to me) that one is as much divine as the other; no more precious (≈øimply in it ≈øelf) then the other: for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117915:5"/> as you have heard, though Lights, yet but Light with God: ≈øo that all that is light, is nothing but God; for Light is Light, and God is light: this may be will in ≈øome mea≈øure be beleeved. But now to the matter in hand, <hi>I will make darkne≈ø≈øe light, and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things ≈øtraight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whether it is intended the darkne≈ø≈øe of the night to become the light of the day, or it is the Dark, as in ≈øeveral portions of Scripture is recorded: yea it is intended that you call the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe in the Creature, which darkne≈ø≈øe is ≈øin, hell, and mi≈øery: this darkne≈ø≈øe he will make Light, Heaven, and Felicity; for in God is no darkne≈ø≈øe, ≈øin, nor mi≈øery; yet this will he make Light. So that now I am come to the place where I told you I would ≈øhew you the ri≈øe of Darkne≈ø≈øe, what it is, and why it is called Darkne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>To this end you ≈øhall find in Scripture a two-fold Power, to wit, more Powers than one, yet notwith≈øtanding there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God. From hence you may ob≈øerve the connexion hereof run in the plural, not Power, but Powers; a Power of darkne≈ø≈øe, a Power of light, a Power in the wicked, a Power in the Godly; yet you have held forth in the ≈øame Scripture but one God.</p>
            <p>So then, as it hath been proved, and I beleeve by you all will be granted, that the Power of Light, Life, and Salvation, cometh from God; the Power that acteth in the Godly, hath its ri≈øe from God; but then, What ≈øhall we ≈øay to the Power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, that Power in the wicked? for in them is a great Power, as ≈øaith the Prophet, <hi>I have ≈øeen the wicked in great Power,</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance) the Power in <hi>E≈øau,</hi> in <hi>Pharoah,</hi> the Power in <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat,</hi> by which they crucified Chri≈øt, from whom came this Power? the Scripture ≈øaith, from above, (to wit) from God: yet this was the Power of darkne≈ø≈øe, of ≈øin: was it not a ≈øinfull act to crucifie Chri≈øt? that I know you will all conclude it was a wicked act; and yet this act was according to the will of God, as ≈øaith the Hi≈øtory, <hi>By the Power of God the Kings of the earth ≈øtood up, and the Rulers were gathered together, again≈øt the Lord, and again≈øt his Chri≈øt.</hi> &amp;c. What had they Power from God to de≈øtroy the Son of God? was this the will of God? ≈øo ≈øaith the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117915:6"/> Scripture, by the Power of God they gathered together: What to do? Nothing but what thy hand and thy Councel determined before to be done.</p>
            <p>Well friends, con≈øider this Power in <hi>Pilate,</hi> was a dark, ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Power, yet it came from God; yea, it was the Power of God, as is recorded: <hi>I form light, I create darkne≈ø≈øe, I form Peace, I create evil.</hi> So that let it be a Power, what≈øoever, in whom≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether in Fle≈øh or Spirit, wicked or Godly, it is the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, yea, came from God. So that in time, he will make this Power of darkne≈ø≈øe a Power of Light; that whereas you have called and condemned one Power for a dark ≈øinfull Power; you ≈øhall have it appear to you, as now it is to me, that it is a Power of Light; for you heard this Power came from God, this Power of darkne≈ø≈øe: ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus you may take notice from whence darkne≈ø≈øe hath its ri≈øe, only from God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What Darkne≈ø≈øe is; nothing but light with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Why it is called Darkne≈ø≈øe, is but only in reference to the Creatures apprehen≈øion, to its appearance; ≈øo nothing but imagined Darkne≈ø≈øe: therefore his meaning is, that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth now under the form of Darkne≈ø≈øe, ≈øhall ere long appear in a Vi≈øage of Light, as ≈øaith the Text, <hi>I will make darkne≈ø≈øe light before them.</hi>

            <p> Again, it may be granted by you, as it hath been by ≈øome, that the Power or Powers are of God; yea that Power by which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> per≈øecuted I≈ørael; that Power by which <hi>Pilate</hi> crucified Chri≈øt, yet it will not be granted that God gave the Power ≈øo to do; neither was it the Power, but a corrupt thought, or ≈øinful imagination ari≈øing from the Devil, and their own wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> Being now ≈øurrounded with the black Regiment, who≈øe Commander is the Devil, and the whole legion con≈øi≈øting of the imaginations of the whole Creation, I have no way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcape this Camp and bottomle≈ø≈øe gulf, but by breaking through the Bulwark and ≈øtrong hold fortified again≈øt me.</p>
            <p>So that being armed with a weapon of Maje≈øty, I doubt not but that God in me ≈øhall ca≈øt down tho≈øe ≈øtrong holds and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, yea every thing that exalteth it ≈øelf again≈øt the Power of the mo≈øt high.</p>
            <p>To that end attend the nature of your objection, the ≈øum there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to this effect, that a ≈øinful act, or an act that is ≈øinful, hath not its being in the Power of God, nor produced by the Power of God; no not that act of crucifying the Son of God, but from the Devil, and their ≈øinful imaginations.</p>
            <p>If thou by whom the Objection was rai≈øed, did≈øt nakedly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand the truth therein contained, I ≈øhould not in the lea≈øt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øt thee, but in that thou declare≈øt Truth not knowing it, I am engaged to unfold the ≈øame, that thou mai≈øt know it, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ≈øaye≈øt a ≈øinful act is not produced by the Power of God, its Truth: for that which is not in the Power, cannot be acted by the Power: but an act that is ≈øinful is not in God, nor the Power of God, therefore hath not its being in God, nor acted by the Power of God, for God is light, and in him no darkne≈ø≈øe: but ≈øin is darkne≈ø≈øe, therefore ≈øin is not in God.</p>
            <p>So that yet, notwith≈øtanding that, I mu≈øt tell you as before I have related, that as all Powers are of God, ≈øo all acts, of what nature ≈øoever are produced by this Power, yea this Power of God: ≈øo that all tho≈øe acts ari≈øing from the Power, are as Pure as the Power, and the Power as Pure as God.</p>
            <p>So from hence it comes, there is no act what≈øoever, that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure

            <p>Yet ≈øay you, there is a ≈øinful act, or acts that are ≈øinful; ≈øo that if all that is an act be produced by the Power of God, then why n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As I have ≈øaid, ≈øo I ≈øay again, that tho≈øe acts, or what act ≈øoever, ≈øo far as by thee is e≈øteemed or imagined to be ≈øinfull, is not in God, nor from God, yet ≈øtill, as I ≈øaid, all acts that be are from God, yea as pure as God.</p>
            <p>And yet, notwith≈øtanding that act, or ≈øo much of the act that thou apprehende≈øt ≈øin is not in God, nor ≈øimply in thy ≈øelf: for indeed ≈øin hath its conception only in the imagination; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ≈øo long as the act was in God, or nakedly produced by God, it was as holy as God: but after there is an appearance in thee, or apprehen≈øion to thee, that this act is good, and that act is evil, then ha≈øt thou with <hi>Adam</hi> eat of the forbidden Tree, of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, then ha≈øt thou ta≈øted of that fruit, which is not in God; for ≈øaith the Text, <hi>Out of the mouth of the mo≈øt High proceedeth not evil, and good:</hi> good but not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; for God is good, and good is God: therefore it was he made all things good: yea that which by you is imagined evil, he made good: ≈øo that thou apprehending that from God which is not in God doth of all his Creatures mo≈øt abu≈øe God, in making God the author of that which is not in God, (to wit) Sin. But to the matter in hand, Thou ha≈øt heard all acts that are, had their being and birth from God, yea acted by God, to be plain tho≈øe acts by thee called Swearing, Drunkene≈ø≈øe, Adultery, and Theft, &amp;c.

Well Friends, although the appearance of God in me be as terrible to you, as it were to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in the mount, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding, that what I have ≈øeen and heard, I do not in the lea≈øt tremble, but rejoyce, that I have this opportunity to declare it

            <p>To that end con≈øider what I ≈øaid tho≈øe acts called Swearing, Drunkenne≈ø≈øe, Adultery and Theft, tho≈øe acts, ≈øimply as acts, not as they are called (and by thee imagined) Drunkenne≈ø≈øe, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Theft, that is in and from thy imagination; for there is no ≈øuch act as Drunkenne≈ø≈øe, Adultery, and Theft in God; though by his Power and Wi≈ødom thou execute≈øt this act and that act, yet that appearance by which thou apprehende≈øt and e≈øteeme≈øt them to be acts of ≈øin, that e≈øteemation was not in God, though from God.</p>
            <p>For indeed, it is but imagination, which is not, yea nothing in this, infinite being; for as I ≈øaid before, ≈øo I ≈øay again, the very ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sin, it is only a name without ≈øub≈øtance, hath no being in God, nor in the Creature, but only by imagination; and therefore it is ≈øaid, <hi>the imaginations of your hearts are only evil continually.</hi> It is not the body, nor the life, but the imagination only, and that not at a time, or times, but continually. Herein ≈øin admitting of no form in it ≈øelf, is created a form in the e≈øtimation of the Creature; ≈øo that which is not to God, is found to be in a ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing creature; as you have it related, <hi>One man e≈øteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one day above another, another e≈øteemeth every day alike:</hi> what to one is pure, to another is impure; herein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth but a bare e≈øtimation.</p>
            <p>To this end (≈øaith <hi>Paul) I know and am per≈øwaded, by the Lord Ie≈øus, that there is nothing unclean of it ≈øelf, but to him that e≈øteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the extent thereof is in reference to all things, as well as meats and drinks; let it be what act ≈øoever. Con≈øider what act ≈øoever, yea though it be the act of Swearing, Drunkenne≈ø≈øe, Adultery and Theft; yet the≈øe acts ≈øimply, yea nakedly, as acts are nothing di≈øtinct from the act of Prayer and Pray≈øes. Why do≈øt thou wonder? why art thou angry? they are all one in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; no more holyne≈ø≈øe, no more puritie in one then the other.</p>
            <p>But once the Creature e≈øteemeth one act Adultery, the other hone≈øty, the one pure, the other impure; yet to that man that ≈øo e≈øteemeth one act unclean, to him it is unclean: (as ≈øaith the

            </p>
            <p>Ob≈øerve not the act nakedly, as the act, for we find the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Pray≈øes of ≈øome to be pure, though to others impure: im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure to tho≈øe acting, in relation to the title his apprehen≈øion, his Con≈øcience in the improvement of them is defiled and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for a Swearer, a Drunkard, an Adulterer, and a theef.</p>
            <p>When as a man in purity in light, acts the ≈øame acts, in relation to the act, and not the title: this man [no this man] doth not ≈øwear, whore, nor ≈øteal: ≈øo that for want of this light, of this ≈øingle pure eye, there appeareth Devil and God, Hell and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Sin and holyne≈ø≈øe, Damnation and Salvation; only, yea only from the e≈øteemation and dark apprehen≈øion of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <hi>I will make darkne≈ø≈øe light, rough ways ≈ømooth;</hi> not half light and half darkne≈ø≈øe, not part rough and part ≈ømooth; but as it is ≈øaid, <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ≈øpot in thee.</hi> Ob≈øerve, all fair my Love; in thee only is beauty and purity, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement: my love my dove is but one, thou one, not two, but only one, my love: Love is God, and God is Love; ≈øo all pure, all, light, no ≈øpot in thee.</p>
            <p>So that con≈øider what act ≈øoever is done by thee, in light and love, is light, and lovely; though it be that act called Adultery, in darkne≈ø≈øe, it is ≈øo; but in light, hone≈øty, in that light loveth it ≈øelfe, ≈øo cannot defile it ≈øelf: for love in light is ≈øo pure, that a whore it cannot indure, but en≈øtranges it ≈øelf from darkne≈ø≈øe from whence whoredom has its fir≈øt original.

            <p>When as on the contrary, thou art per≈øwaded that tho≈øe titles in Scripture, and thy apprehen≈øion recorded, for ≈øwearing, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and theft, be no ≈øuch acts with thee, but only titles with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee; neither do≈øt thou apprehend them any other, but pure acts, without title: then I declare, according to thy e≈øteema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øo is the act to thee, and for ≈øo doing, thy imagination, will not, cannot condemne thee, but ≈øay with the Apo≈øtle, <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing:</hi> what thou e≈øteeme≈øt Idolatry, to us is none: So that what≈øoever I act, though it be that act you call ≈øwearing, adultery, and theft, yet to me there is no ≈øuch title, but a pure act, for there is nothing that I do that is unclean to me, no more then it is unclean of it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>And yet notwith≈øtanding this, my priviledge doth not in the lea≈øt approbate thee, yea thee that apprehende≈øt the title to ≈øweare, whore or ≈øteal, &amp;c. becau≈øe to thee it is unclean, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not lawfull for thee: neither can≈øt thou upon the bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port hereof, ≈øay, Well, if it be but as man e≈øteems it, then I will e≈øteem it ≈øo too.</p>
            <p>Alas friend, let me tell thee, whatever thy tongue ≈øaith, yet thy imagination in thee declares ≈øad things again≈øt thee, in that thou e≈øteeme≈øt them acts of ≈øin, thy imagination will torment thee for this ≈øin, in that thou condemne≈øt thy ≈øelf, thou art tormented in that condemnation; with endle≈øs mi≈øery: ≈øo that I ≈øay, Happy is the man that condemns not him≈øelf in tho≈øe things he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of.</p>

            <p> No matter what Scripture, Saints, or Churches ≈øay, if that within thee do not condemn thee, thou ≈øhalt not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for ≈øaith the Hi≈øtory, <hi>Out of thine own mouth,</hi> not anothers, <hi>will I judge thee:</hi> Therefore, remember that if thou judge not thy ≈øelf, let thy life be what it will, yea act what thou can≈øt, yet if thou judge not thy ≈øelf, thou ≈øhalt not be judged; For, <hi>I came not into the World to condemn, but to ≈øave the World.</hi> But if the reproach and ≈ølander of Saints and Churches do cau≈øe thee to que≈øtion thy ≈øelf, then art thou ready to ≈øay within what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port without, I am guilty of what they accu≈øe me: So that true is the ≈øaying, <hi>O Adam,</hi> thy de≈øtruction is of thy ≈øelf.</p>
